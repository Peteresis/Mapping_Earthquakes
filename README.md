# Module 13 Challenge: Mapping Earthquakes
---
This project uses Leaflet and JavaScript to create an interactive map that is displayed on a website

---
## :one: Project Overview

The objective of this challenge was to display GeoJSON seismic data on a map using the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API). Each earthquake is represented by a circle with a different colors and size to show the magnitud of the quake.  The larger the diameter and the darker the color, the more powerful the quake. It is also possible to see the magnitude and position of an earthquake by clicking on any circle and reading the earthquake's pop-up marker.


## :two: Elements of the Site

The site presents several elements using the layers that are shown in the upper-right container.

The bottom layer is the map itself, which offers 3 possibilities layers map of earthquakes around the world contains:

Switch on/off button for fault lines of tectonic plates.
Switch on/off button for earthquakes of the past 7 days.
Switch on/off button for major earthquakes of magnitude above 4.5.
Three different map styles:
Street view.
Satellite view.
Dark view.
A popup marker with information about the location and magnitude of the earthquake.
The diameter and the color of a marker reflect the strength of the earthquake (darker color with larger diameter represent earthquakes with a higher magnitude).
A legend with the context for the map.
