# Module 13 Challenge: Mapping Earthquakes
---
This project uses Leaflet and JavaScript to create an interactive map that is displayed on a website

---
## Project Overview

The objective of this challenge was to display GeoJSON seismic data on a map using the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API). Each earthquake is represented by a circle with a different colors and size to show the magnitud of the quake.  The larger the diameter and the darker the color, the more powerful quake. It's also possible to see the magnitude and position of an earthquake by clicking on an earthquake's pop-up marker.
